# Welcome
Documentation of the various Linux distributions that HCL Domino is running on. 

# Background
The [HCL Domino](https://www.hcltechsw.com/domino/) product release notes and [system requirements](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0073794) are only listing Linux distributions that HCL has successfully completed compatibility tests on. This is what some customers might describe to be "certified", for HCL those are the 'supported' Linux distributions.

## Supported / Cerified

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Server 7.4+, 8.0+, 9.0+
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 12.2, 15.0
- CentOS 7.4+
 
In addition to those, customers can run [HCL Domino](https://www.hcltechsw.com/domino/) on **any** Linux distribtion that meets certain minimum requirements.
